# Chapter 01: Rust Basics

## What You'll Learn
- Rust's fundamental data types (integers, floats, booleans, chars, strings)
- Control flow structures (if/else, loops)
- Collections (arrays, HashMaps)
- Basic function syntax

## Why It Matters
Understanding Rust's type system and control structures is essential for writing safe, efficient code. Rust's explicit type annotations and ownership rules help prevent common programming errors at compile time.

## Core Ideas
- **Type Safety**: Rust requires explicit type declarations or inference
- **Mutability**: Variables are immutable by default, use `mut` for mutable ones
- **String Types**: `&str` (borrowed) vs `String` (owned)
- **Control Flow**: Pattern matching and iteration patterns

## Projects in This Chapter
